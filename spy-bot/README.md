This question will test your ability to architect a system.

Your company wishes to collect data about it's competitors. Please design a system that will allow them to do so.
Your artifacts should include database diagrams and system specifications as well as a complete playbook
of how you would manage and code the project (technology used, project management methodolgy etc).

Your system should consider things like collecting mass data from online social sources, scraping competitor
web pages and job advertisements to get a sense of what areas the competitors are considering expanding into.

You should also design a reccomendation engine and dashboard (working prototype please) that will use the data 
collected to provide appropriate suggestions for strategic decisions within your own company - this may range 
from being "first to market" on a product you think your competitors are beginning to make through to poaching
any hires they may be attempting to make so they have a shallower pool of human resource on which to draw.
